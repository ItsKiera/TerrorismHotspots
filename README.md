## Project Overview
This project utilizes the Dash web framework to create an interactive dashboard for visualizing terrorism trends from 2000 to 2017. The following visualizations were developed using Plotly:

- **Heatmap** â€“ Highlights the concentration of how frequent certain attack methods are used across various regions globally.
- **Scatter Geo Map** â€“ Displays global terrorism incidents over time, with a slider to track changes year over year.
- **Scatter Plot** â€“ Shows correlations between the number of total incidents, and casualties, based on attack methods to measure there effectiveness.

## Interactive Features

- **Dropdown Filter** â€“ Allows users to analyze the effectiveness of different attack methods based on the casualties per incident ratio, by filtering the data based on the selected attack method type.
- **Time Slider** â€“ Enables users to visualize how terrorism trends have evolved from 2000 to 2017.
